# Interactive Spotify Data Analysis Tool

## 🎵 Overview
This project is an **interactive data analysis tool** designed for exploring **Spotify data** using visual analytics. Built with **Shiny in R**, this application enables users to investigate **musical trends, genre popularity, and key audio characteristics** of songs. The tool is particularly useful for **music producers and analysts** seeking insights into what makes a song popular.

## 📌 Features
- **Interactive heatmaps** to analyze loudness across different sections of a song.
- **Streamgraphs** to visualize how genre popularity has evolved over time.
- **Parallel coordinate plots** to compare different genres based on key audio features.
- **Bubble plots** to study the relationship between energy, beats per minute (BPM), and song popularity.
- **User-friendly web interface** built using **Shiny**.
- **Data sourced from the Spotify API**, including the **Billboard TikTok Top 50 songs** for analysis.

## 📊 Data Sources
The project utilizes **Spotify API** data, analyzing various song attributes such as:
- **Loudness**: Variation of volume within different parts of a song.
- **Genre Popularity**: Evolution of musical genres over time.
- **Audio Features**: Energy, danceability, instrumentalness, speechiness, and more.
- **BPM & Popularity**: Examining how tempo influences a song’s success.

## 🚀 Getting Started
### 1️⃣ Install Required Packages
Ensure you have **R** and **RStudio** installed. Then, install the required dependencies:
```r
install.packages(c("shiny", "shinyWidgets", "ggplot2", "dplyr", "bslib", "shinyBS", "GGally", "viridis"))
```

### 2️⃣ Run the Application
Set your working directory to the project folder and execute:
```r
library(shiny)
runApp()
```
This will launch the web application in your browser.

## 📺 Application in Action
The **Shiny app** is also deployed online! You can access it here:
[Live App Deployment](https://rcmartemp.shinyapps.io/datavisualization/)

## 🛠 Implementation Details
- **Language & Framework**: Developed in **R** using **Shiny**.
- **Visualizations**:
  - **ggplot2**: Used for custom plots.
  - **GGally**: Generates parallel coordinate plots.
- **Interactivity**: Users can filter and customize their analysis dynamically.

## 📌 Key Insights
- **Loudness Analysis**: Heatmaps provide insights into song structure without listening to the audio.
- **Genre Popularity**: Temporal trends in music genres are displayed via streamgraphs.
- **Audio Features Comparison**: Parallel coordinates allow simultaneous analysis of multiple song attributes.
- **Song Popularity Drivers**: Bubble plots uncover the correlation between energy, BPM, and success.
